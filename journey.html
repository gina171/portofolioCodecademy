                    <p>As you can see I started going to 2 universities at the same time but only continued with one of them. My entire teen life I said that I want to study psychology but then after learning what it's like I figured this isn't exactly something for me long term. I will complete my study here because it's too late to quit now.</p>

                    <p>I realized that I want to be a web developer because it's more fun than having to be a therapist and listen to people's problems all day. Ok I have more reasons why: i like creating stuff. And so I started learning how to code.</p>
